3.0.0
-----

- Fix: correctly handle awarding of userpoints on profileicon upload / update.

2.3.3

2.3.2
-----

- Requires Elgg 2.3 at minimum,
- Major code rewrite and cleanup (thanks a lot also to Jer√¥me Bakker from Coldtrick for the help),
- Userpoints API updated for consistency (this means any plugin using the userpoints API functions like Elggx Badges or Gifts and others need to be updated to continue to work!),
- Userpoints deletion functionality reworked and expanded (if you enabled to deletion of userpoints option it should work more stable now and it's also capable of deleting userpoints awarded for actions that are connected with Elgg annotations and metadata in addition to Elgg entities as before); this should also prevent people from gaining userpoints by mis-use (e.g. liking/unliking the same content repeatingly),
- New userpoints action options for profile editing and avatar uploading to set a blocking period before userpoints are awarded again for these action (to prevent mis-use),
- New tab on members page (bundled Members plugin must be enabled, of course) that list site members sorted by their userpoints,
- Widget layout (profile page, dashboard and index page) re-worked to match the listing style of Elgg core,
- Widget edit form now uses number input to set number of items to display,
- Check for valid input data in processing of admin actions,
- Droped support for classified and recommendation plugin actions (these plugins seem not being maintained for so long already).

2.0.1
-----

2.0.0
-----

- Updated for Elgg 2.0 (should also work on future Elgg 2.X versions).

1.10.14
-------

- composer.json added.

1.10.13
-------

- No longer call parent constructor in Userpoint class with guid as parameter (this has been deprecated in ELgg 1.9),
- Fixed version check in activate.php (old implementation was no longer working starting with 1.10 as it compared the version strings from left to right resulting in 1.9 seen as newer than 1.10...),
- Correctly display userpoints previously set to be provided for making a comment in corresponding input field on Userpoints Point settings tab,
- Using input/select instead of input/dropdown view.

1.10.12
-------

- Based on version 1.9.11,
- Fix of deprecation issues occuring on Elgg 1.10 (namely changing output/confirmlink view to output/url view).

1.9.11
------

- Updated version 1.8.11 for Elgg 1.9.

1.8.11
------

- Minor layout adjustment for a user's userpoints info on profile pages,
- Layout adjustments for userpoints' plugin settings pages,
- Replacing private Elgg API functions where possible.

1.9.10
------

- Updated version 1.8.10 for Elgg 1.9.

1.8.10
------

- Fix in create/delete object and create annotation plugin hook callback functions to NOT rely on a (in some cases not available) logged-in user entity to assign userpoints to but using the owner_guid of the object or annotation respectively instead.

Attention: this has been kind of a critical / serious issue hidden in the code even before I took over the plugin an ported it to Elgg 1.8. It might finally explain the loss of userpoints in some cases (or rather the fact that the userpoints were just not shown anymore) as this issue might have been interfering with processes of other plugins which affected the userpoints plugin in return. I noticed it only for myself on Elgg 1.9 with the Elggchat plugin chat session cleanup cronjob not working (while there wasn't the same issue on Elgg 1.8). But depending on what plugins you have installed on your site there might have been other conflicts.

1.9.9
-----

- Updated version 1.8.9 for Elgg 1.9.

1.8.9
-----

- Fix (thanks to atima): pagination on "Details" tab in admin section to work correctly when viewing the userpoints history of a specific user,
- Fix (thanks to atima): resetting userpoints of a user now removes all userpoints object of this user,
- Fix: resetting userpoints for all site users works now,
- Improvement: Usage of an ElggBatch on deleting (resetting) userpoint objects to avoid memory issues,
- Fix: current number of userpoints of a user displayed on profile page under the large profile icon is really only displayed on profile pages and not anywhere else where the large profile icon might be used (restriction to "profile" context).

1.9.8
-----

- Updated version 1.8.8 for Elgg 1.9,
- Fixed a deprecation issue on Elgg 1.9.

1.8.8
-----

- Added functionality to check integrity of a user's userpoint metadata entry on adding/substracting userpoints to avoid "Array()" issue to happen or fixing it if it already did happen (Can't promise this works as I've still not be able to reproduce this issue myself!),
- Added option to awarding userpoints on uploading a profile image.

1.9.7
-----

- Updated version 1.8.7 for Elgg 1.9.

1.8.7
-----

- Fixed awarding of points on starting a new group discussion topic and replying in a group discussion.

1.9.6
-----

- Updated for Elgg 1.9,
- Supports addition and (new) substraction of userpoints for comments (possible as comments are now saved as ElggComment objects and no longer as annotations on Elgg 1.9).

1.8.6
-----

- Spanish language file added (thanks to Gonzalo / GEARinvent).

1.8.5
-----

- Fixed pagination on list, detail and moderate tabs on Elggx Userpoints plugin settings page.

1.8.4
-----

- New admin options to restore (re-calculate) a user's userpoints or all users' userpoints. This option might be useful in case the metadata entry containing a user's current number of userpoints gets corrupted due to server glitches.

1.8.3
-----

- Added a German language file,
- Index page widget added (useable with Widget Manager plugin),
- Branding (e.g. configuring the words to be used for the "Points" terms) moved from plugin settings to language files (to allow for branding to be configured in more than one language),
- Better visibility of "Reset All Points" link by making it an Elgg Action button,
- Some general code cleanup,
- Fixed userpoints handling of Tidypics upload images and create albums actions,
- Fixed userpoints handling of invitations (among getting it to work at all Siteaccess plugin and Contact_importer plugin are now no longer support in invitation userpoint handling).

Remarks about userpoints for invitation of friends:

- The same person (related to the email address used for the invitation) can be invited by different users and each of these users will be awarded points for inviting this person.
- You can opt for userpoints only to be awarded after the invited person joined the site or to be awarded already when the invitation is sent. In both cases a pending userpoint entry will be generated (appearing on the "Moderate" tab). In the first case the pending userpoints entry will contain the userpoints to be awarded to the user when the invited person joins the site. In the latter case the userpoints will be awarded immediately and the pending userpoints entry (0 points pending) will serve as blocking mechanism preventing the same user from inviting the same person more than once.
- If you use the Uservalidationbyemail plugin the pending userpoints will only be awarded after the account of the invited user is validated (or an admin validates the account). If you don't use this plugin the points are awarded when the user registers an account already.
- If you use the expiration date plugin you can define an interval for pending userpoints for outstanding invitations to expire. Or in case you opt for userpoint for invitations to be awarded immediately the pending userpoints entry blocking the re-invitations of the same person will expire.
